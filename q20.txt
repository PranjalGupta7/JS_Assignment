While performing or operator if one of the comparing side is non-zero or not-null non-zero value is print.
While [performing and operator only if both comparing sides are non-zero then a non-zero value is print.

The value is seet based on type of operation:

1) Or: If and only if first number from left most side is zero then the next value is checked and value of the variable is overriden by it.

2) And: Both the value are needed to be checked therefore always would get the last value between which the comparision is taking place.
